# GO-CONNECTOR

The connector is a modular HTTP server acting as a middleware between the Trace API and a client application.

It is meant to be deployed on-premise on the client infrastructure, in order to benefit from the ability to access the decrypted data. Itâ€™s purpose is to handle all the logic that cannot be handled in Trace backend:

- Decryption
- Validation that cannot be performed sever side
- Replication
- Search
- Analytics

It leverages go plugins to offer flexibility in the way these modules are used.
